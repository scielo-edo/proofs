<!-- * sec--><h2>OBJECTIVE:</h2>
<p> To estimate the prevalence of chronic pain and its association with socioeconomic and demographic status, and leisure physical activity in the elderly population. </p>
<!-- * sec--><h2>METHODS:</h2>
<p> This study is part of an epidemiological cross-sectional population-based household survey called EpiFloripa Elderly 2009-2010, which was conducted with 1,705 elderly individuals (≥ 60 years) residents of Florianópolis, Santa Catarina. From the positive response to chronic pain, the associations with the variables were investigated through a structured interview. Descriptive statistics were conducted, including ratio calculation and 95% confidence intervals. In crude and adjusted analysis, Poisson regression was utilized, estimating prevalence ratios, with 95% confidence intervals and ≤ 0.05 p-values. </p>
<!-- * sec--><h2>RESULTS:</h2>
<p> Among the subjects, 29.3% (IC95% 26.5 - 32.2) reported chronic pain. Adjusted analysis showed that being female, having less years of schooling, and being in worse economic situation were significantly associated with a higher prevalence of chronic pain. Being physically active during leisure time was significantly associated with lower prevalence of the outcome. </p>
<!-- * sec--><h2>CONCLUSIONS:</h2>
<p> Therefore, it is clear that chronic pain affects a considerable amount of elderly individuals. Social inequalities are a harmful influence in these individuals' quality of life, inasmuch as those inequalities increase the frequency with which chronic pain afflicts them. At the same time, physical activity during leisure time decreases chronic pain frequency. It is fundamental that public health policies subsidize multidisciplinary pain management programs, which should include health targeted physical activity for the elderly, thus preventing the decrease in quality of life that chronic pain brings to this population.</p>

<p>The world population has been going through a fast and gradual aging process<!--1--><span class="ref"><sup class="xref xrefblue">1</sup><span class="refCtt closed"><span>1.

            </a></span></span>. According to this tendency, population aging is a reality in Brazil. According to data from the last demographic census conducted by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) in 2010, the number of elderly people (60 years old or more) represented 11.3% of the Brazilian population<!--2--><span class="ref"><sup class="xref xrefblue">2</sup><span class="refCtt closed"><span>2.

<p>This change in the Brazilian age structure is directly related to the epidemiological transition, because the older the population gets, the higher the prevalence of chronic health problems. Among the consequences that demographic transition and longevity bring to society, pain is one of the most significant ones; in many cases, chronic pain is a major complaint of individuals, and considerably interferes in the quality of life of the elderly<!--3--><span class="ref"><sup class="xref xrefblue">3</sup><span class="refCtt closed"><span>3.

<p>In a temporal context, pain can be classified as acute or chronic. Acute pain is associated with body injury; it lasts little and disappears when the injury is healed. Chronic pain, on the other hand, is persistent and recurrent, and is not necessarily associated with body injury<!--4--><span class="ref"><sup class="xref xrefblue">4</sup><span class="refCtt closed"><span>4. Souza JB. Poderia a atividade física induzir analgesia em pacientes com dor crônica? Rev Bras Med Esporte 2009; 15(2): 145-50.</span></span></span>.

<p>The prevalence of chronic pain in studies involving the elderly is very diverse, depending on the characteristics of the study population and the used methodology.

<p>Despite the considerable negative influence of chronic pain on the quality of life of the elderly, which configures a public health problem, in our country only a few population-based epidemiological studies have addressed this subject. In Santa Catarina, this is the first analysis about this theme, and can be a base for other studies to emerge, thus contributing with the diffusion of such knowledge. Therefore, the objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence of chronic pain and its association with the socioeconomic and demographic situation, as well as the level of physical activities during leisure time in the elderly population of Florianópolis, Santa Catarina. </p>
<!-- * sec--><h1 class="articleSectionTitle">METHODS</h1>
<p>This is a cross-sectional epidemiological study conducted with the data from the project "<i>Condições de Saúde da População Idosa do Município de Florianópolis, Santa Catarina: Estudo de Base Populacional</i>" (EpiFloripa Idoso 2009-2010).</p>
<p>The study was carried out in the urban zone of the city of Florianópolis, capital of the state of Santa Catarina. Florianópolis is located in the center-east region of the state, and most of the city (97.23%) is located in the island of Santa Catarina. According to the United Nations, the city presented municipal Human Development Index (M-HDI) of 0.847, in 2010, thus holding the third position among all Brazilian cities<!--1--><span class="ref"><sup class="xref xrefblue">1</sup><span class="refCtt closed"><span>1.

            </a></span></span>.</p>
<p>According to the data from the last demographic census conducted by IBGE, the city's life expectancy at birth is 79.1 years old, and total fertility rate is 1.4 children per woman<!--2--><span class="ref"><sup class="xref xrefblue">2</sup><span class="refCtt closed"><span>2.

            </a></span></span>. The estimated population in Florianópolis in 2009 was of 408,163 inhabitants, and 44,460 were aged 60 years old or more (18,844 male and 25,616 female participants), thus representing 10.9% of the total population<!--13--><span class="ref"><sup class="xref xrefblue">13</sup><span class="refCtt closed"><span>13.

            </a></span></span>. The study population was constituted by male and female elderly people, aged 60 years old or more, living in the urban zone of Florianópolis, Santa Catarina. For sample calculation, the following parameters were used: the population was comprised of 44,460 elderly people, prevalence for the unknown outcome (50%), sampling error 4 percentage points and 95% confidence interval (95%CI). The sample was multiplied by 2 because of the design effect of the study (deff), plus 20% of predicted loss and 15% for studies of association, accounting for 1,599 individuals. </p>
<p>For this investigation, the sample calculation was conducted afterwards, by considering the 51.4%<!--3--><span class="ref"><sup class="xref xrefblue">3</sup><span class="refCtt closed"><span>3. Dellaroza MS, Pimenta CA, Matsuo T. Prevalence and characterization of chronic pain among the elderly living in the community.

Since this study was part of the EpiFloripa Idoso, the highest calculated sample was used. A two-stage cluster sampling was adopted for this study. In the first stage, the 420 urban census sectors of the city were placed in increasing order according to monthly average income of the head of the family, by systematically raffling 80 of these sectors (8 sectors in each income decile). </p>
<p>The units of the second stage were the households. One stage was necessary to update the number of households in each sector (listing), once the most recent census had been conducted in 2000. The study supervisors visited the raffled census sectors and started counting the inhabited households, by following the guidelines of IBGE. The number of households ranged from 61 to 725. In order to decrease the coefficient of variation in the number of households per sector, sectors with less than 150 households were clustered, and sectors with more than 500 households were divided, by respecting the corresponding income decile, which resulted in 83 census sectors. The initial coefficient of variation was 52.7% (n = 80 sectors), and the final one was 35.5% (n = 83 sectors).</p>
<p>According to data from IBGE<!--14--><span class="ref"><sup class="xref xrefblue">14</sup><span class="refCtt closed"><span>14. Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística - IBGE. Perfil dos Idosos responsáveis pelos domicílios no Brasil 2000.

            </a></span></span>, the estimation was that 60 households should be visited per sector to find 20 elderly people. Households were raffled systematically, and all elderly people living in these places were invited to participate in the study. Due to the availability of financial resources, the estimation involved 23 interviews per census sectors, thus enabling the variability of the sample; therefore, 1,911 elderly people were eligible for the study. The non-response rate was of 10.9%, which led to a final sample of 1,705 elders who were effectively interviewed. Institutionalized elderly people were excluded from this study.</p>
<p>Loss was considered when interviews were not conducted after four attempts (at least on in the evening and one on the weekend). Refusals involved subjects refusing to answer the questionnaire, and replacements were not admitted. Data collection was conducted by properly trained female interviewers, by means of a structured questionnaire with pre-codified questions applied in a face-to-face interview, by using the Personal Digital Assistants (PDA), after the conduction of a pre-test and a pilot-study in sectors that were not part of the study. The consistency of data and quality control were verified every week by a telephone survey reduced in 10% of the randomly selected interviews. </p>
<p>The outcome or dependent variable of this study was the prevalence of chronic pain in the elderly population of Florianópolis, Santa Catarina. Therefore, a structured questionnaire about chronic pain was applied with five questions<!--15--><span class="ref"><sup class="xref xrefblue">15</sup><span class="refCtt closed"><span>15.

The elderly people were asked about the sensation of pain on most days (yes/no); for how long (&lt; 3 months, between 3 and 6 months and &gt; 6 months); feeling pain in several parts of the body in the past month, for instance, back, legs, arms, neck or head (yes/no); if the pain lasted for more than 15 days (yes/no); and, also, in a pain scale, in which zero represented absence of pain, and one hundred, maximum bearable pain, how the person assessed pain in the past week. Considering the subjective aspect of the question about chronic pain, all of the interviews answered by an informer or a caretaker were excluded from the analysis. </p>
<p>The control or independent variables were: sex, age group (60 - 69; 70 - 79; 80 years old or more); marital status (married/with a partner, single/divorced, widower); schooling (0 - 4; 5-8; 9 - 11; 12 years or more); family income in quartiles (1<sup>st</sup> quartile: ≤ R$ 327.50, 2<sup>nd</sup> quartile: R$ 327.50 to R$ 700.00, 3<sup>rd</sup> quartile: R$ 700.00 to R$ 1,500.00, 4<sup>th</sup> quartile: &gt; R$ 1,500.00); having a paid job (yes/no); worse, similar or improved economic status in comparison to the time they were 50 years old.

<p>All of the study variables were descriptively analyzed by means of absolute and relative frequency. Descriptive statistics included calculations of proportions and 95% confidence intervals for categorical variables. In order to test the association between the outcome (prevalence of chronic pain) and control variables (socioeconomic and demographic aspects and physical activity during leisure time), crude and adjusted analyses were conducted by the Poisson regression method, by estimating the crude and adjusted prevalence ratios with 95% confidence intervals and p-value (obtained by the Wald's test)<!--19--><span class="ref"><sup class="xref xrefblue">19</sup><span class="refCtt closed"><span>19.

Variables presenting p ≤ 0.05 in the crude analysis were selected to enter the adjusted model, and they remained in the model in case they reached p values ≤ 0.05 and/or were adjusted to the model. The statistical package Stata 9.0 (Stata Corp., College Station, the United States) was used, and for all of the analyses the effect of the sample design was considered by the svy command, designed to analyze data from complex samples.</p>
<p>The project was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina, protocol n. 352/2008, on December 23, 2008. Participants were informed about the objectives of the study, and signed the informed consent form.</p>
<!-- * sec--><h1 class="articleSectionTitle">RESULTS</h1>
<p>From the original sample of 1,911 elderly people eligible for the study, 1,705 individuals (89.2%) were interviewed, which corresponded to a 10.8% non-response rate (n = 206), ranging from 8.5% in the first income decile and 22.0% in the highest decile. The main reasons for losses (n = 206) were: "there was nobody home", "the elder was travelling", "scheduled with the interviewer and did not show up", "was on vacation", "was very ill", "there was an angry dog in the yard". There were 3 losses caused by hospitalization at the time of the interview, which did not affect the results. The main reasons for refusal were: "did not want to give interviews", "very long interview", "no time to answer the interview", "thinks it is a waste of time to answer interviews", "does not believe in research". </p>
<p>Among the 1,705 investigated elderly people, 59 interviews were excluded from the analyses for being answered by informers/caretakers, therefore accounting for 1,656 elders, out of whom 29.3% (95%CI 26.5 - 32.2) presented with chronic pain. In the study sample, women were prevalent (62.5%), as well as elderly people aged from 60 to 69 years old (51.7%), married people or those living with partners (58.9%) and with low schooling (40.0%). Most elderly people did not work (86.5%) and 48.6% mentioned that the economic status improved in comparison to when they were 50 years old. With regard to physical activities during leisure time, 68.5% of the elderly people were classified as being insufficiently active during leisure time (<a href="" class="open-asset-modal" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#ModalTablet04"><span class="sci-ico-fileTable"></span>Table 1</a>).</p>

<!-- * sec--><h1 class="articleSectionTitle">DISCUSSION</h1>
<p>The main findings of this study show important associations between the prevalence of chronic pain and socioeconomic and demographic status with physical activity during leisure time in the elderly population of the city of Florianópolis. The highest prevalence of chronic pain was significantly associated with being female, having lower schooling and worse economic status. On the other hand, being physically active during leisure time was associated with the lower prevalence of the outcome.</p>
<p>In this investigation, the prevalence of chronic pain in the elderly population of the city of Florianópolis was of 29.3%. Dellaroza et al.<!--3--><span class="ref"><sup class="xref xrefblue">3</sup><span class="refCtt closed"><span>3. Dellaroza MS, Pimenta CA, Matsuo T.

The fact that this study was conducted with a convenience sample, that is, only municipal servants, may have contributed with the result of observing higher prevalence of chronic pain than what was found in this study.</p>

In this study, it is possible to observe that the sample (n = 172) was very small and not so representative, once these elderly people only correspond to people using one basic health unit of a specific location in the city of Londrina. Therefore, it does not represent the entire population of the city. It is also worth to mention that the elderly people selected for the study already complained of pain, which may have also contributed with the high percentage of chronic pain.</p>

<p>Women may take the event of pain more seriously, since the multiple responsibilities and roles resulting from taking care of relatives and managing the household are reasons for them to think of pain as a threat. Besides, the meaning of pain for men and women may be influenced by social and cultural rules, which allow women to express or manifest pain, while encouraging men not to consider it. These factors should contribute with the higher number of complaints related to pain among women<!--21--><span class="ref"><sup class="xref xrefblue">21</sup><span class="refCtt closed"><span>21.

<p>In this study, elderly people with lower schooling presented higher percentages of chronic pain when compared to other levels. In a study conducted by Dellaroza et al.<!--3--><span class="ref"><sup class="xref xrefblue">3</sup><span class="refCtt closed"><span>3. Dellaroza MS, Pimenta CA, Matsuo T. Prevalence and characterization of chronic pain among the elderly living in the community. Cad Saúde Pública 2007; 23(5): 1151-60.</span></span></span>, the authors found that elderly people who had from two to four schooling years presented higher percentage of chronic pain. In another study about the prevalence of chronic pain in the population of Salvador, individuals with lower schooling presented higher percentage of chronic pain in comparison to those with medium and high schooling<!--22--><span class="ref"><sup class="xref xrefblue">22</sup><span class="refCtt closed"><span>22. Sá K, Baptista AF, Matos MA, LessaI I. Prevalência de dor crônica e fatores associados na população de Salvador, Bahia. Rev Saude Publica 2009; 43(4): 622-30.</span></span></span>. Therefore, the low schooling is probably related to high percentages of chronic pain among the individuals.</p>
<p>This is an expressive result, since it reflects the social conditions of the beginning of last century, demonstrating that access to education was restricted. The educational possibilities more than half a century ago were little, and people needed to work in order to provide for their families. Considering that the schooling level has an important influence on the access to information, it can be determinant for the search for treatments, and also for self-care, since elderly people should be able to look after themselves, and knowing how to read is a contributive factor<!--27--><span class="ref"><sup class="xref xrefblue">27</sup><span class="refCtt closed"><span>27.

<p>In this study, it was observed that being physically active during leisure time was significantly associated with lower prevalence of chronic pain. The practice of physical activities by the elderly, especially during leisure time, provides opportunities for a more active, healthy and independent life, thus contributing with the maintenance of autonomy and improved quality of life<!--28--><span class="ref"><sup class="xref xrefblue">28</sup><span class="refCtt closed"><span>28.

In a cross-sectional study conducted with the population of Norway, the authors found 10 to 12% lower prevalence of chronic pain among individuals aged 20 - 64 years old who practiced moderate physical activities three times a week; among the older ones, depending on the intensity of the exercise, there was a 21 - 38% reduction in the prevalence of chronic pain<!--29--><span class="ref"><sup class="xref xrefblue">29</sup><span class="refCtt closed"><span>29.

<p>Among the strategies employed by multidisciplinar programs addressed to treating chronic pain, physical activity is one of the most used ones<!--30--><span class="ref"><sup class="xref xrefblue">30</sup><span class="refCtt closed"><span>30.

One of the mostly accepted hypotheses about the benefits of exercises for managing chronic pain is owed to the fact that its influence is related to endogenous pain control mechanisms<!--32--><span class="ref"><sup class="xref xrefblue">32</sup><span class="refCtt closed"><span>32.

<p>Some limitations of this study should be considered, especially the cross-sectional design, which does not enable causality relations between the prevalence of chronic pain and the other investigated variables with the self-reported measurements of the studied variables. However, it is not relevant to know, in this case, if the elderly presented lower prevalence for the outcome because they were physically active, or if the fact of being physically active led to lower prevalence for the outcome, because being physically active may have been beneficial both for maintaining health, thus avoiding the onset of chronic pain, and for reducing the intensity and duration of pain among the elderly who already presented with chronic pain. Among the positive aspects, the study stands out for the relevance and originality of the theme, which can be the base for other investigations, and for the fact that the sample is large and represents the elderly people of the city of Florianópolis. It is also worth to mention that the high response rate of the study contributed with its internal validity and reduced the chances of systematic errors.</p>
<!-- * sec--><h1 class="articleSectionTitle">CONCLUSION</h1>
<p>The fact that women, individuals with low schooling, the ones with worse economic status and those who were insufficiently active presented higher prevalence of chronic pain among the elderly represents an important finding, which can subsidize public health policies focused on assistance for this population. </p>
<p>Therefore, the results suggest that campaigns addressed to preventing chronic pai should mostly be aimed at women, with low income and insufficiently active during leisure time. It is also necessary to create multidisciplinary management programs and chronic pain control, including guidance to health professionals so that they can work on preventing chronic pain and physical activities specifically addressed to the elderly population, with the objective of preventing chronic pain from being responsible for problems in the quality of life of the elderly.</p>
