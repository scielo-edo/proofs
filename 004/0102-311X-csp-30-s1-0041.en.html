<p></p>
<p>The concern with birth in Brazil is not new. Since the 1990s, the Brazilian Ministry of
        Health has sought to ensure good obstetric and neonatal practices, and a proper environment
        for what should be a moment of celebration and joy. The Stork Network (launched in 2011 as
        one of the five primary health policies in Brazil) reinforced such commitment, and stressed
        the urgency in reviewing care processes in Brazilian maternity facilities.</p>
<p></p>
<p>However, from a national perspective, the analysis of perinatal indicators, and the
        experiences undergone by Brazilian women indicate the existence of a challenging scenario.
        This was the scenario a group of investigators lead by Prof. Maria do Carmo Leal looked
        into, with the research <i>Birth in Brazil</i> . Managers, researchers, health
        practitioners, and social movements had in their hands an unprecedented and weighty study
        that documents the medically and physiologically unexplainable care practices of childbirth
        processes.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I contribute to this discussion by sharing the same unease shown by the authors, who
        highlight the difficulties in the interpretation of Brazilian data, and the opposing
        care-delivery processes in their different variables (region of the country, access to
        private health-care networks, years of schooling, ethnicity/skin color, and type of birth
        delivery). It is within this perspective of contradiction that I present my stand: despite
        the current scenario, we experience a fertile and promising time for reviewing ideas, values
        and, therefore, care-delivery practices.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This moment we are experiencing now can be characterized by a set of situations and
        elements capable of synergistic action to effectively change birthcare and delivery in
        Brazil. In this process, I highlight: (1) a considerable increase in the number of studies
        on care deficiencies and institutional abuse; (2) sustainable experiences of good public
        perinatal practices developed in cities such as Belo Horizonte (Minas Gerais State) and Rio
        de Janeiro, which included reviewing of routines and monitoring process and outcome
        indicators, environmental interventions, and of the role of obstetric nursing in
        habitual-risk births; (3) focus of federal government actions considered a priority for
        maternity facilities of the Northern and Northeastern regions, through the Maternities
        Qualification Plan; (4) consolidation of the National Humanization Policy as the driving
        force in health-provision networks, which ensures institutional support for the development
        of best practices; (5) expansion of obstetric nursing training, making more practitioners
        available and skilled in the management of habitual-risk births; (6) appreciation by
        strategic players in Brazilian obstetrics of evidence-based medical practice to replace the
        repetition of unnecessary or harmful practices to habitual-risk the delivery and birth; (7)
        strong and increasing dissatisfaction of women with their experience in public and private
        maternities.</p>
<p></p>
<p>These are movements that occur with different hues, and social and regional differences,
        but that bear the same importance. Studies on care deficiencies and institutional abuse in
        maternities have strengthened social movements and are fostering discussions and action in
        bodies such as the Public Ministry and Legislatures.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The experiences in capital cities of the Northeastern region reinforce the analysis of the
        authors about higher adhesion to good practices in this area, which is known for its
        important role in the countrywide dissemination of knowledge and practices. Similarly, the
        characteristics of the development of the Stork Network (attention to “how to do”, and
        provision of institutional support to less developed areas) evidence that its purpose goes
        beyond the expansion of the existing capacity; otherwise there would be “more of the
        same”.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Even though still incipient countrywide, the growing role of obstetric nursing, due to its
        positive impact in the improvement of outcomes <!--1--><span class="ref"><sup class="xref">1</sup><span class="refCtt closed">1 Sandall J, Soltani H, Gates S, Shennan A, Devane D. Midwife-led continuity
          models versus other models of care for childbearing women. Cochrane Database Syst Rev
          2013; 8: CD004667.</span></span> , is decisive to change the way birth occurs in Brazil. The
        experiences of more than a decade in maternities and birthcare facilities managed by the
        local government in the cities of Rio de Janeiro and Belo Horizonte have become important
        sites for development of knowledge and systematization of practices. Since 2012, a number of
        initiatives involving the federal government, universities and nursing organizations are in
        place, to intensify professional training under different modalities (residency, continuing
        education, refresher courses), for practitioners to work in maternities throughout the
        country.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The valuation of “evidence-based obstetrics”, recognized and accepted worldwide, as well as
        its positive influence in the training of new generations of obstetricians, has been seen in
        maternities that present indicators closer to the ones of countries with the best perinatal
        indices. Some of these practitioners, since their training, are exposed to institutional
        environments in which, from the physical structure of the facilities to the established
        routines (including the role of obstetric nursing <!--1--><span class="ref"><sup class="xref">1</sup><span class="refCtt closed">1 Sandall J, Soltani H, Gates S, Shennan A, Devane D. Midwife-led continuity
          models versus other models of care for childbearing women. Cochrane Database Syst Rev
          2013; 8: CD004667.</span></span> ), favor the physiology of the habitual-risk delivery.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The dissatisfaction with institutional routines with little focus on the woman and her
        family is increasing gradually, with the rising awareness of rights within Brazilian
        society. In the public care facilities, the right to have a companion present serves as an
        important example, and it is becoming irreversible countrywide. On the other hand, women who
        use the private sector are very incisive in claiming their right to normal vaginal delivery.
        As odd as this may sound in countries such as England, France or Canada, Brazil presents
        c-section delivery rates close to 90% in the private sector, which makes the claim easier to
        understand. A number of testimonies of users and doctors of the private sector mention
        elements foreign to the medical process to account for performing a c-section. This seems to
        me an irreversible movement, and its connection to the Brazilian film <i>O Renascimento
          do Parto (“The Revival of Delivery”)</i> , shown in paid movie theaters, is an
        encouraging sign of such a process.</p>
<p></p>
<p>From these thoughts and my confidence in the possibilities of change, I share with the
        authors and readers my certainty about the long path ahead of us. Among the many and complex
        issues that require a lot of thinking, there are three that I believe are the core ones: (1)
        re-discussion and re-arrangement of perinatal care processes in university hospitals. The
        limited role of obstetric nursing at the scene of delivery in these institutions that are
        known to be opinion-makers, hampers and delays in the academic setting, the revision of
        medical practices and routines, research, knowledge production, and the ongoing training and
        education of the different professional categories; (2) just like the authors, I highlight
        the prenatal care provided by the public health network as an instrumental agent for women
        to be given much of the ownership in regards to the physiology and importance of normal
        vaginal delivery, deconstructing the commonly perceived negative experiences often
        disseminated in our milieu; (3) revision of the processes in the production of care in the
        private sector, lessening the impact of external factors to the medical care when deciding
        on the type of delivery.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I end by mentioning and appreciating the role of an organization that is thoroughly
        strategic for the necessary and urgent revisions in obstetric care in Brazil. In a recent
        and historical stand on delivery and habitual-risk birth, the Brazilian Federation of
        Gynecology and Obstetrics (FEBRASGO. http://www.febrasgo.org.br/site/?p=7069, accessed on
        29/Jan/2014) advocates practices known to increase the satisfaction of pregnant women with
        vaginal delivery (diet, privacy, comfort, walking-capacity, relaxation, freedom for
        selecting position in the second stage, limited use of episiotomy), supports intra-hospital,
        dystocia-free birthcare centers, the role of obstetric nursing in public and private
        clinics, and the creation of on-call teams to provide normal vaginal delivery care in
        HMO-managed facilities. This is a stand that reinforces my confidence of a new era for those
        who are born in Brazil.</p>
