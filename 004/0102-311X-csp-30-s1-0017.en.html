<p>This study evaluated the use of best practices (eating, movement, use of
					nonpharmacological methods for pain relief and partograph) and obstetric
					interventions in labor and delivery among low-risk women. Data from the
					hospital-based survey Birth in Brazil conducted between 2011 and 2012 was used.
					Best practices during labor occurred in less than 50% of women and prevalence of
					the use of these practices was lower in the North, Northeast and Central West
					Regions. The rate of use of oxytocin drips and amniotomy was 40%, and was higher
					among women admitted to public hospitals and in women with a low level of
					education. The uterine fundal pressure, episiotomy and lithotomy were used in
					37%, 56% and 92% of women, respectively. Caesarean section rates were lower in
					women using the public health system, nonwhites, women with a low level of
					education and multiparous women. To improve the health of mothers and newborns
					and promote quality of life, a change of approach to labor and childbirth that
					focuses on evidence-based care is required in both the public and private health
					sectors.</p>

<!-- * sec--><h1 class="articleSectionTitle">Introduction</h1>
<p>There is robust scientific evidence that certain practices during pregnancy and
					childbirth are effective in reducing adverse perinatal outcomes. Factors
					affecting maternal health influence pregnancy outcomes and quality antenatal
					care may contribute to a reduction in adverse outcomes in mothers and newborns.
					Furthermore, a significant proportion of potential complications during labor
					and childbirth may be avoided with adequate obstetric care based on the use of
					appropriate technology. At the same time, the inappropriate use of techniques to
					forgo the use of obstetric interventions can compromise the health of mothers
					and babies 1.</p>
<p>Although Brazil has achieved universal antenatal care coverage and a hospital
					birth rate of over 98% in 2010, the maternal mortality ratio still remains high
					(68.2/100,000 live births), as does the perinatal mortality rate, suggesting
					flaws in the quality of maternal and perinatal care (Health Informatics
					Department – DATASUS. http://tab net.datasus.gov.br/cgi/idb2011/C03b.htm).</p>
<p>Although several national level studies have been conducted in the last decade to
					assess antenatal care coverage, including time to hospital admission, number of
					antenatal check-ups, and performance of obstetrical procedures 2, national level
					studies to describe practices and procedures used during labor and childbirth
					have yet to be carried out. Studies regarding the use and frequency of best
					practices and unnecessary obstetric interventions in Brazil by geographic area
					that also take into account the socioeconomic status of mothers, parity and type
					of health care involved (public or private) do not exist.</p>
<p>Although relevant, Brazilian Ministry of Health initiatives such as the
					development of technical manuals 3, reminders and other educational materials
					for healthcare professionals have proven insufficient to change the highly
					interventionist approach to obstetric care in a country which has the world’s
					highest Caesarean section rates 4.</p>
<p>Given the high rate of healthcare coverage provided by the Brazilian Unified
					National Health System (SUS), the question arises as to whether the persistent
					negative picture painted by the maternal and perinatal health indicators in
					Brazil is a result of low quality obstetric care.</p>
<p>The aim of this study is to describe best practices in childbirth care (eating
					and mobility during labor and childbirth, use of nonpharmacological methods of
					pain relief and monitoring of labor with the use of a partograph) and obstetric
					interventions (intravenous catheters, oxytocin drips, amniotomy, epidural, the
					uterine fundal pressure maneuver, episiotomy and caesarean section) among
					low-risk women using a representative sample of Brazilian hospitals that perform
					500 or more deliveries a year.</p>
<!-- * sec--><h1 class="articleSectionTitle">Methods</h1>
<p>Birth in Brazil is a national hospital-based survey of postnatal women and
					newborns conducted between February 2011 and October 2012.</p>
<!-- * sec--><h2>Sample design</h2>
<p>The study sample was selected in three stages. In the first stage hospitals
						that performed 500 or more births in 2007 were stratified according to
						geographical region, location in or outside a state capital, and type of
						hospital health care (private, public or both). Hospitals were selected with
						probability proportional to the number of births in each stratum. In the
						second stage an inverse sampling method was used to select the number of
						days (minimum of seven) necessary to carry out 90 interviews of postnatal
						women in each hospital. In the third stage the following eligibility
						criteria were used to determine the final sample: hospital birth, regardless
						of birth weight or gestational age; live birth or stillborn weighing more
						than 500g or gestational age of over 22 weeks.</p>
<p>Sampling weights represented the inverse probability of being included in the
						sample. A weighting calibration procedure was used for each selection
						stratum to ensure that estimated totals matched the number of births in the
						sample population in 2011. The results presented are estimates based on a
						sample of 23.940 postnatal women derived from the study population
						(2,337,476).</p>
<p>For each stratum the sample size was calculated based on an estimated
						caesarean section rate of 46.6% (based on data from the year 2007), a 5%
						significance level to determine a difference of 14% between type of health
						care, a statistical power of 95% and design effect of 1.3, resulting in a
						minimum sample of 450 women per group from a total of 266 hospitals spread
						over 191 municipalities.</p>
<!-- * sec--><h2>Data collection</h2>
<p>In the first phase of the study data was obtained from two sources:
						interviews conducted with postnatal women during hospitalization within the
						first 24 hours after birth; mother and newborn medical records consulted
						after hospital discharge or death. In the case of prolonged postpartum
						hospital stays, records were analyzed up to the 42nd day of hospitalization
						for mothers and up to the 28th day for newborns. In the case of postnatal
						transfers of mothers and/or newborns, data was obtained from the hospital
						records of the transfer destination, even when the hospital was not part of
						the original sample of the study. In the case of refusal or early discharge
						the participant was replaced by a new subject selected from the same
						hospital. A digital photograph of antenatal notes was taken when available
						and the relevant data from the notes was inputted into electronic forms.
						Follow-up telephone interviews were conducted before six months and at
						twelve months postpartum to assess maternal and newborn outcomes. All field
						work was conducted by healthcare professionals or healthcare students under
						the supervision of the research team. Further information about the sample
						design and data collection are detailed elsewhere 5,6.</p>
<!-- * sec--><h2>Subjects</h2>
<p>Women were defined as low-risk according to the following criteria used by
						Dahlen et al. 7: absence of pre-existing or pregnancy-related hypertension
						or diabetes; body mass index &lt; 30 (above which the person is considered
						obese); HIV negative; gestational age between 37 and 41 weeks; singleton
						pregnancy with cephalic presentation; birth weight between 2,500 and 4,499g
						and between the 5th and 95th centiles of birth weight for gestational
						age.</p>
<p>The Birth in Brazil survey sample (23,894 individuals) represents a total of
						2,337,475 postnatal women of which 56.8% were classified as low-risk. All
						low-risk women were included in the analysis of type of birth. With respect
						to the analysis of interventions during labor, women who did not go into
						labor (28.1%) were excluded. With regard to interventions during vaginal
						birth, those women that had caesarean sections (45.5%) were excluded.</p>
<p>Since the number of eligible postnatal women was lower than in the total
						sample, it was necessary to perform post-hoc sample size calculations. Based
						on an estimated prevalence rate for interventions during birth of 50% and a
						significance level of 5%, the smallest sample used in this study (analysis
						of interventions during vaginal birth, n = 6,740) had a 90% power to detect
						a difference of at least 3,5%.</p>
<p>The following exposure variables were considered by this study: Geographic
						Region (North, Northeast, Southeast, South and Central); source payment
						(public, private); age (&lt; 20; 20 to 34; 35 years or over); years of
						education (seven or less; eight to 10; 11 to 14; 15 or more); self-rated
						skin color/race based on the five categories used by the Brazilian Institute
						of Geography and Statistics (IBGE: white, black, brown, yellow and
						indigenous); and parity (0; one to two; three or more previous births).</p>
<p>Women who delivered in public health care facilities and women who delivered
						in mixed health care facilities that were not paid by health insurance plans
						were classified as “public source of payment”. Women whose delivery was paid
						by health insurance plan, and the delivery occurred in mixed or private
						hospitals, and women who delivered in private facilities, regardless if the
						delivery had been paid or not by the health insurance plan, were classified
						as “private source of payment”.</p>
<p>The outcomes evaluated by this study were best practices and interventions
						during labor and childbirth. The following best practices were analyzed:
						eating during labor; use of nonpharmacological pain relief; mobility during
						the first stage of labor; and monitoring progress of labor using a
						partograph. Another best practice is the presence of a companion during the
						entire period of hospital stay, which will be the subject of another article
						in this special issue 8. The following interventions during labor were
						considered: the use of a peripheral venous catheter; the use of an oxytocin
						drip; amniotomy (for women with intact membranes at hospital admission); and
						spinal/epidural analgesia. The following interventions during childbirth
						were evaluated: use of the supine (with the legs elevated) or lithotomy
						positions; use of the uterine fundal pressure maneuver (vaginal births);
						episiotomy (vaginal births); and caesarean section.</p>
<p>Information about eating during labor, use of nonpharmacological pain relief,
						mobility during the first stage of labor and interventions such as the use
						of a peripheral venous catheter, lithotomy and uterine fundal pressure were
						reported by postnatal women during the interview. Information regarding the
						use of a partograph, oxytocin drip, amniotomy, spinal/epidural analgesia and
						type of birth was collected from the patient’s medical records.</p>
<!-- * sec--><h2>Statistical analysis</h2>
<p>Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to identify the
						sociodemographic characteristics associated with the outcomes. All of the
						exposure variables were included in this analysis. These variables were
						carefully chosen to represent the different sociodemographic factors that
						may influence the prevalence of these interventions. A significance level of
						5% was adopted.</p>
<p>The statistical analysis software package used for this analysis was IBM
						SPSS, version 19.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, USA).</p>
<p>This research was carried out in accordance with the National Health Council
						Resolution n. 196/96 which provides guidelines and human research standards
						under the research protocol CEP/ENSP – n. 92/10. All hospital directors and
						postnatal women signed an informed consent form.</p>
<!-- * sec--><h1 class="articleSectionTitle">Results</h1>
<p>Eating during labor and use of nonpharmacological pain relief occurred in less
					than 30% of cases, while mobility during labor and monitoring labor progress
					using a partograph occurred in 45% of cases. A peripheral venous catheter was
					used in more than 70% of cases, while an oxytocin drip and amniotomy were used
					in around 40% of cases. Spinal/epidural analgesia was used in around 30% of
					cases. During childbirth, the supine or lithotomy position, uterine fundal
					pressure maneuver and episiotomy were used in 92%, 37% and 56% of cases,
					respectively. Except for eating during labor, the use of best practices in
					obstetric care was more frequent among low-risk women than in women at risk.
					This was also found to be the case for the majority of interventions during
					labor and childbirth (oxytocin drip, amniotomy, uterine fundal pressure and
					episiotomy). With respect to type of birth, 48.1% were vaginal, 5% vaginal
					without obstetric interventions during labor and birth (normal birth) and 51.9%
					were Caesarean deliveries. Caesarean section rates and normal birth rates in
					low-risk women were 45.5% and 5.6%, respectively (<a href="" class="open-asset-modal" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#ModalTablet01_en"><span class="sci-ico-fileTable"></span>Table 1</a>).</p>

<p>Eating during labor was most frequent in the Southeast Region, while the use of
					nonpharmacological pain relief and monitoring progress of labor using a
					partograph was less frequent in the North, Northeast and Central Regions. In
					contrast, mobility during labor was more frequent among women from the South
					Region than in women from the Southeast Region. Women without private health
					insurance who gave birth in public hospitals were more likely to experience the
					use of good practices. No association was found between the use of best
					practices and the variables education level and skin color/race. Older women
					were less likely to experience the use of nonpharmacological pain relief and
					monitoring of progress of labor using a partograph. The use of all good
					practices, except the use of a partograph, was more frequent among primiparous
						women(<a href="" class="open-asset-modal" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#ModalTablet02"><span class="sci-ico-fileTable"></span>Table 2</a> and <a href="" class="open-asset-modal" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#ModalTablet03"><span class="sci-ico-fileTable"></span>3</a>).</p>
<p>After controlling for potential confounders, the use of an oxytocin drip was
					significantly less frequent in the poorest regions of the country (North,
					Northeast and Central). For those women without health insurance, the use of a
					peripheral venous catheter and spinal/epidural analgesia was less frequent,
					while the use of an oxytocin drip and amniotomy was more frequent. The use of a
					peripheral venous catheter and spinal/epidural analgesia was less frequent among
					teenagers. With respect to women with a lower level of education (≤ 7 years),
					the use of an oxytocin drip (OR = 1.53, 95%CI: 1.03-2.28) and amniotomy (OR =
					1.98, 95%CI: 1.38-2.84) was more frequent, while the use of spinal/epidural
					analgesia (OR = 0.48, 95%CI: 0.32-0.71) was less frequent. The use of all
					interventions during labor, except amniotomy, was more frequent in primiparous
					women, while in multiparous women the use of a peripheral catheter and
					spinal/epidural analgesia was less frequent (<a href="" class="open-asset-modal" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#ModalTablet04"><span class="sci-ico-fileTable"></span>Table 4</a> and <a href="" class="open-asset-modal" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#ModalTablet05"><span class="sci-ico-fileTable"></span>5</a>).</p>

					according to the different variables. The use of the lithotomy position was more

					Central Region and in primiparous women and slightly less frequent among women
					with low levels of education.</p>
<p>The highest caesarean section rates were found in the Central Region (50.2%).
					After controlling for potential confounders, older (≥ 35) and primiparous women
					were more likely to have a caesarean section. Women with no health insurance,
					teenagers, women in the lowest level of education category, nonwhite individuals
					(except yellow skin color) and multiparous women were less likely to have a

<!-- * sec--><h1 class="articleSectionTitle">Discussion</h1>
<p>This study used comprehensive criteria to define low-risk women with the goal of
					excluding any possible risk that could justify the use of interventions during
					labor and birth.</p>
<p>Prevalence of the use of best practices (eating, mobility during the first stage
					of labor, use of nonpharmacological pain relief methods and monitoring progress
					of labor using a partograph) varied. Rates were generally below 50% and were
					higher among low-risk women. On the other hand, prevalence rates of obstetric
					interventions during labor and birth were high, particularly for the use of the
					lithotomy position and venous catheters.</p>
<p>Brazil is known worldwide for its high caesarean section rates. This study
					confirms this situation with a rate of 45.5% among low-risk women. Furthermore,
					the study noted excessive medical interventions during labor and vaginal
					delivery, with only 5.6% of low-risk women and 3.2% of primiparous low-risk
					women (data not shown) having normal natural childbirth. In Australia, a country
					where interventions during labor have also increased in recent decades, 15% of
					women attending the private health system had a normal birth, compared to 35% of
					those attending the public health system 7. In the United Kingdom, normal births
					accounted for 41.8% of total births in 2011, 97% of which were in public
					hospitals 9.</p>
<p>It should be noted that all obstetric interventions, except for the use of venous
					catheters, obstetric analgesia and caesarean section, were more frequent among
					low-risk women. This demonstrates that these actions are largely unnecessary and
					fulfill the role of ritualistic repetition of procedures that fail to consider
					patients needs and scientific evidence.</p>
<p>This approach to labor and childbirth care, with the overuse of obstetric
					interventions, is not supported by scientific evidence. The use of episiotomy
					was observed in over 50% of low-risk women and almost 75% of first-time births.
					This practice has been used routinely since the beginning of the last century,
					with the intention of avoiding perineal trauma, reducing the risk of subsequent
					urinary and fecal incontinence, and protecting the newborn from birth trauma.
					However, episiotomy has become a routine practice in obstetric care without any
					accompanying research to assess its risks and benefits.</p>
<p>Controlled studies show that episiotomy increases the risk of perineal
					laceration, third and fourth degree tears, infection and bleeding without
					reducing the long-term complications of pain, urinary and fecal incontinence 10.
					For these reasons, clinical guidelines discourage the routine use of episiotomy
					11.</p>
<p>Episiotomy rates recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) are between
					10 and 30% 1. In Canada episiotomy rates decreased from 38% to 24% between 1993
					and 200112 and in Finland rates decreased from 42% in 1997 to 25% in 2009 10.In
					France, between 2003 and 2010, episiotomy rates declined in primiparous women
					and multiparous women from 71% to 44% and 36% to 14%, respectively 13, while in
					2012 in the United States the vaginal delivery rate was 17% 14.</p>
<p>Despite the benefits of the vertical position for the mother and fetus, the
					lithotomy position was used in 90% of low-risk women15.</p>
<p>Our study shows that the use of an oxytocin drip and artificial rupture of the
					amniotic membrane is widely used to speed up labor. Both interventions were used
					in approximately 40% of low-risk women, and were more common in women who had
					source of payment and lower levels of education. The rate of use of the uterine
					fundal pressure maneuver in vaginal deliveries was also relatively high (37%).
					The use of an oxytocin drip and amniotomy are part of the concept of “active
					management of labor” to reduce the duration of labor and the rate of surgical
					delivery 16,17,18. The Cochrane Systematic Reviews highlight a modest reduction
					in the number of Cesarean sections when the “active management” approach is
					adopted. However, the benefits of this small reduction must be balanced against
					the risks of interventions in low-risk women and this issue requires further
					research 19,20,21. There is no evidence of the benefits of the routine use of
					the uterine fundal pressure maneuver 22 and strong recommendations exist to
					avoid its routine use.</p>
<p>A key issue raised by the literature is the relationship between epidural
					analgesia and childbirth interventions. There is strong evidence that epidurals
					are associated with an increased risk of instrumental vaginal birth 23. Although
					a recent Cochrane Systematic Review comparing epidurals with other analgesia
					techniques found no evidence of a statistical difference in the risks of
					caesarean section, it has been suggested that the rate of cross over in trials
					masks the relationship between epidurals and Caesarean sections 24. A paper by
					Kotaska et al 25 and an editorial by Klein 26 also argue that the review lacks
					external validity and that there is sufficient evidence to suggest that epidural
					analgesia associated with low-dose oxytocin augmentation leads to an increase in
					caesarean births. The only uncontaminated randomized controlled trial to
					demonstrate an association between epidurals and caesarean sections was
					published 16 years ago 27. This small trial showed that women giving birth for
					the first time who were randomly assigned to receive an epidural were 11.4 times
					more likely to have a caesarean due to dystocia than women who were randomly
					assigned to receive narcotic analgesics. The trial was discontinued on the
					grounds that it was unethical to randomly assign women to have an epidural.
					Epidurals are also associated with an increased rate of induction or
					augmentation of labor 28 and the use of antibiotics for maternal fever 29.</p>
<p>Current WHO and Brazilian Ministry of Health recommendations regarding labor
					management include the provision of isotonic beverages, the adoption of the
					vertical position and freedom of movement and the use of nonpharmacological
					methods to relieve pain, such as massage, shower or immersion in warm water to
					increase maternal comfort and ease labor. These techniques are affordable,
					noninvasive and inexpensive, and can be provided by both public and private
					healthcare services 1,30,31.</p>
<p>Systematic reviews indicate the benefits of adopting the best practices during
					labor and childbirth evaluated by this study. The adoption of an upright
					position and freedom of movement during labor reduces the duration of labor and
					does not seem to be associated with increased interventions or negative effects
					on the well-being of mothers and babies 32,33. Also there is no evidence to
					support the restriction of fluids and food during labor for low-risk women 34.
					Nonpharmacological methods for pain relief are noninvasive and appear to be safe
					for the mother and the baby. Available evidence does not support the routine use
					of a partograph as a strategy to reduce caesareans and adverse outcomes, and its
					use should be defined locally. Studies conducted in less developed countries
					showed that lower caesarean section rates are associated with the use of a
					partograph and early identification of slow labor progress 35.</p>
<p>Prevalence of best childbirth practices was lower in the less developed North and
					Northeast Regions of the country. Although the rate of other interventions was
					also lower in these regions, this data does not necessarily reflect the adoption
					of a less interventionist and more “natural” approach to care. This situation is
					more likely to represent the neglect of pregnant women rather than a humanized
					care model, since these regions present the lowest rates of best practices and
					obstetric and perinatal indicators are the worst in the country.</p>
<p>The highest rates of best practice and lowest rate of use of venous access was
					observed in women attending the public health system. These results are probably
					due to Brazilian Ministry of Health efforts to promote a humane approach to
					childbirth through the dissemination of best practices manuals, ordinances and
					public policies and skills training for healthcare professionals 3,36. As the
					instrument used did not allow the identification of women who gave birth paid by
					direct disbursement, it is possible that some women had their delivery assisted
					in mixed health care facilities and were classified as having public source of
					payment, having paid for their delivery care. However, as these women had very
					similar socioeconomic characteristics of women attending public hospitals, it is
					likely that misclassification occurred in a few cases. As it is a
					non-differential misclassification with respect to the outcomes studied, it is
					expected that there has been attenuation of the magnitude of the observed
					associations.</p>
<p>Moreover, the persistent use of practices that exacerbate pain and unnecessary
					interventions such oxytocin drips, amniotomy, episiotomy and the uterine fundal
					pressure maneuver, demonstrate that improvements in the quality of care are
					needed. The use of oxytocin drips during labor was also more common among SUS
					users and women with lower levels of education. These same groups experienced
					lower rates of use of obstetric analgesia, exacerbating pain during childbirth
					and consequently inducing fear and anxiety about vaginal delivery and increasing
					the prestige of the Caesarean section among Brazilian women.</p>
<p>A satisfaction study regarding labor and birth among women who participated in
					the Birth in Brazil survey 37 found lower levels of satisfaction and higher
					levels of violence among women who went through labor. There was significant
					association between the professional relationship between health professionals
					and pregnant women, showing that women highly value how they are treated.
					Patient neglect in the SUS has been widely reported in the lay press and even
					the Ministry of Health’s ombudsman found that 12.7% of women claim poorly
					quality of care, going unheard, mistreatment and even suffering verbal and
					physical abuse 38. The data presented in this study demonstrates that changing
					care practices alone is not enough if not accompanied by changes in the
					relationship between healthcare professionals and users.</p>
<p>The study also shows that the use of best practices and obstetric interventions
					was more frequent in primiparous women, who usually have a longer duration of
					labor. It was also found that primiparous women were more likely to be admitted
					to hospital in the early stages of labor (dilated to three or less centimeters)
					(data not shown), meaning that they become more exposed to hospital routines
					such as episiotomy, caesarean section and uterine fundal pressure that may lead
					to scarring and loss of tissue integrity.</p>
<p>Women with higher levels of education gave birth in private hospitals. While they
					were more likely to undergo a caesarean section, use epidural and be subjected
					to episiotomies, they were less exposed to the use of oxytocin.</p>
<p>The analysis of the variables according to skin cooler/race showed no set
					pattern. In general, indigenous women showed similar results to white women and
					yellow and brown skin color/race showed similar results to black color. A
					possible explanation for these results may be the subjectivity of the
					classification technique which was self-reported.</p>
<p>Best practices were most commonly used in low-risk women. Surprisingly, obstetric
					interventions were also more common, with the exception of venous catheters and
					epidural analgesia. With regard to the prevalence of the interventions studied,
					the caesarean section showed the biggest difference in rates between the risk
					groups and the rate was particularly high in the low-risk group.</p>
<p>It is well known that Brazil’s caesarean section rate is the highest in the
					world, close to that of China (46.2%), Turkey (42.7%), Mexico (42%), Italy
					(38.4%) and the United States (32.3%), and much higher than that of England
					(23.7%), France (20%) and Finland (15.7%) 40.</p>
<p>Caesarean section rates were much lower in public hospitals, and among non-white
					women with lower levels of education, repeating a familiar pattern of inequality
					in Brazil 41,42 and in other countries 7,43 and showing that excessive rates of
					caesareans mainly affect Brazilian women with higher levels of education,
					affecting 89.9% of low-risk women that use the private health system.</p>
<p>The negative effects of caesarean section for the mother and newborn are known. A
					multicenter study of hospitals in eight Latin American countries 44 that
					evaluated the risks and benefits of the caesarean section compared to vaginal
					birth with cephalic presentation concluded that the caesarean section increased
					the risk of severe morbidity and maternal and neonatal mortality.</p>
<p>Similar results were found by Souza et al. 45 in a study carried out in 2010 that
					included countries in Latin America, Africa and Asia, leading the authors to
					conclude that the caesarean section should be performed when there is an
					indication that the benefits outweigh the risks of this surgery.</p>
<p>Hansen et al. 46 studied a cohort of high and low-risk women attending Aarhus
					University Hospital in Denmark and found that babies born by elective caesarean
					section had a higher risk of mild and severe respiratory morbidity, that
					increased with decreasing gestational age, than those born vaginally, suggesting
					that labor fulfils an important role in the maturation of the child’s lung
					46.</p>
<p>The caesarean section is also a well recognized risk factor for the subsequent
					development of abnormal placentation 47. An analysis of the University of
					Chicago’s database showed that an increase caesarean section rates was one of
					the factors associated with a five-fold increase in the rate of placenta previa
					48.</p>
<p>Caesarean section rates were highest in the Center West Region and lowest in the
					North. However, after logistic regression, the North Region was shown to have
					the highest odds ratio showing that the likelihood of a pregnancy resulting in a
					caesarean section was greater in this region. This is due to the low coverage of
					private health plans in the North Region and higher caesarean section rates in
					both public and private hospitals in the region (the caesarean section rate was
					two and half times higher in private hospitals than in public hospitals).</p>
<p>Controlling for intervening variables surprisingly showed that the likelihood of
					having a Caesarean section was lower in the Southeast, despite being the richest
					region in the country and comprising the highest proportion of women with
					private source of payment. Best practices were also more prevalent in this
					region where the natural childbirth movement is stronger and more women and
					healthcare professionals are in favor of the humanization of childbirth care and
					this finding may therefore reflect the beginnings of a reversal of the
					interventionist approach.</p>
<p>One of the most striking aspects of obstetric practices in Brazil is the tendency
					to attempt to speed up delivery in total disrespect of the autonomy of laboring
					women. Obstetric care ends up being centered on doctor’s decisions and not the
					dynamics of the female body and attempts to control the timing and duration of
					childbirth explains the excessive use of interventions, including caesarean
					sections. This process begins during antenatal care when women are not informed
					about best practices, the benefits of normal birth and appropriate obstetric
					care. This process continues at chilbirth with the imposition of a cascade of
					interventions that are not based on scientific evidence and result in negative
					experiences of childbirth.</p>
<p>Given the size and cultural diversity of Brazil, the interpretation of medical
					data is a complex process. However, the significant differences in caesarean
					rates between geographic regions may suggest varying approaches to labor and
					childbirth across the country. The cross-sectional nature of this study does not
					allow temporal trend analysis.</p>
<p>It may be concluded that low-risk Brazilian women are unnecessarily exposed to
					the risks of iatrogenic adverse effects during childbirth, regardless of their
					socioeconomic status. A number of unnecessary interventions were performed,
					particularly in women from the more affluent social groups, who may be more
					prone to the effects of the inappropriate use of medical techniques.</p>
<p>Socially disadvantaged women are more likely to suffer from the use of painful
					procedures such as speeding up labor with the use of an oxytocin drip and low
					uptake of obstetric analgesia. However, these groups had greater access to best
					practices in labor and childbirth care. Empowering women and promoting the use
					of evidence-based care are strategies to promote the humanization of childbirth
					care, and reduce inequality between the rich and the poor.</p>
<p>Finally, there is an urgent need to move towards a humanized approach to
					obstetric care that promotes evidence based practices to improve the health and
					quality of life of mothers and newborns.</p>
