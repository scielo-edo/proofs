<p>The authors thank their colleagues for having accepted being discussants of this
				article on obstetric interventions during labor and delivery of Brazilian women
				considered to be of habitual obstetric risk. The contribution by each of them made
				expanded and enriched the discussion, by shifting it from the scientific realm of
				health to the context of culture, ethics and social relations as a whole.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It is with great excitement and motivation that we respond to their comments,
				addressing some selected aspects only, due to space limitations of this section.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Guilherme Cecatti made some important notes on methodological issues, particularly
				addressing the lack of information on the use of forceps in Brazil, in the article.
				This was suppressed, given the many outcomes addressed in our investigation.
				However, considering that one of the core purposes of our paper was to present an
				overview of birthcare in Brazil in women considered at normal obstetric risk, we
				thank Cecatti the chance of commenting about this topic. The frequency of forceps
				use was very low, of 1.4% for all women, and of 1.9% for those of habitual obstetric
				risk, with higher prevalence seen in the Southeastern region, capital cities, and
				users of the Brazilian Unified National Health System (SUS), as well as in
				adolescents, white, and primiparous women, without differentiation of the obstetric
				risk group. In regards to obstetric aspects, there was a higher frequency of all
				other interventions for those women in which forceps was used, particularly
				peridural anesthesia, use of ocytocin, Kristeller’s maneuver, and episiotomy, which
				reached the high proportions of 60%, 56% and 86%, respectively. Some studies have
				shown that the frequency of forceps use in Brazil is low, and the main reason for
				this obstetric procedure to have been dropped almost entirely was the lack of
				medical training to qualify doctors to perform surgical vaginal delivery care, and
				their concern with law suits <!--1--><span class="ref"><sup class="xref xrefblue">1</sup><span class="refCtt closed">1 <span> Faundes A, Cecatti JG. A operação Cesárea no Brasil. Incidência,
					tendências, causas, consequências e propostas de ação. Cad Saúde Pública 1991;

					indicação pelo obstetra em uma maternidade pública no Município do Rio de
					Janeiro. Cad Saúde Pública 2004; 20:109-16.</span></span></span>. In our investigation, we had no way to assess the proper
				use of forceps, and therefore we cannot state whether or not this low rate of use is
				a positive factor, more so when such procedure is associated to high prevalence of
				Kristeller’s maneuvre, and higher severe morbidity rates and maternal near miss
					<!--3--><span class="ref"><sup class="xref xrefblue">3</sup><span class="refCtt closed">3 <span> Dias MAB, Domingues RMSM, Schilithz AOC, Nakamura-Pereira M, Diniz

					hospitalar: dados da pesquisa Nascer no Brasil. Cad Saúde Pública 2014; 30
					Suppl:169-81.</span></span></span> .</p>
<p></p>
<p>Another aspect mentioned by Cecatti was the decision, by the authors, to include in
				the study women of habitual obstetric risk previously submitted to a c-section. It
				is correct to imagine that these women may present higher risks during labor and
				delivery compared to those who did not previously experience a c-section. However,
				it seemed appropriate not to consider a previous c-section an excluding factor for
				normal obstetric risk because: (a) in this group, the proportion of women previously
				submitted to a c-section was the same of the obstetric risk group, 20%. This means
				that in regards to this aspect, there was no difference between the two groups; (b)
				scientific evidences show successful experiences in having a vaginal delivery after
				having had a c-section <!--4--><span class="ref"><sup class="xref xrefblue">4</sup><span class="refCtt closed">4 <span> Rossi AC, D’Addario V. Maternal morbidity following a trial of
					labor after cesarean section vs elective repeat cesarean delivery: a systematic
					review with metaanalysis. Am J Obstet Gynecol 2008; 199:
					224-31.</span></span></span>. The most
				important international protocols, among them the one of the American College of
				Obstetricians and Gynecologists <!--5--><span class="ref"><sup class="xref xrefblue">5</sup><span class="refCtt closed">5 <span> American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. ACOG Practice
					bulletin no. 115: Vaginal birth after previous cesarean delivery. Obstet Gynecol
					2010; 116(2 Pt 1):450-63.</span></span></span>,
				indicate the importance of providing women with previous c-section the experience of
				being in labor, as a strategy to decrease the repetition rate of this surgery. In
				Brazil, where the rates of c-section are the highest in the world, it is
				instrumental that such a strategy de in place in the routines of maternity
				facilities. In our study, more than 80% of women classified as being of habitual
				obstetric risk with previous c-section were submitted to another c-section, 88% of
				them being performed without the pregnant women going into labor. The excessive use
				of c-section in this group discloses a worrisome scenario in Brazil, given the
				growing tendency of this procedure be performed in primiparous women.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As to the use of epidural analgesia, we agree with Cecatti that it should not be
				considered unnecessary, but it is striking in Brazil the inequalities in the offer
				of pharmacological and non-pharmacological pain relief techniques. The birth and
				delivery care model that does not favor physiological childbirth uses drugs
				excessively, increases pain and fear of delivery and, paradoxically, to relieve the
				suffering of the women, uses more drugs.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As for the uterine fundal pressure, there is no evidence of this being beneficial.
				The potential risks of Kristeller maneuver include uterine rupture, anal sphincter
				lesion, fractures or brain damage in newborns, among others <!--6--><span class="ref"><sup class="xref xrefblue">6</sup><span class="refCtt closed">6 <span> Verheijen EC, Raven JH, Hofmeyr GJ. Fundal pressure during the
					second stage of labour. Cochrane Database Syst Rev 2009;
					(4):CD006067.</span></span></span>. Unfortunately we have no way to assess the
				conditions in which the maneuvre was performed on the women who were investigated in
				this study; however, we believe it was not performed in more than one third of women
				classified of presenting habitual obstetric risk. In a setting of so many
				interventions and institutional abuse, Kristeller maneuvre should be considered an
				unnecessary practice until robust evidences of their effectiveness and safety
				justify their use.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Maria Luiza Riesco highlights the importance of the study and its originality, and
				draws attention for a possible decrease in the performing of episiotomy, considering
				the data published by the 2006 <i>Brazilian National Survey of Demographics and
					Health </i>(PNDS). A decrease in the incidence of episiotomy in Brazil
				might have occurred. However, one should be careful when comparing PNDS data with
				data from the <i>Birth in Brazil</i> study because: (1) PNDS included all
				women who had a vaginal delivery, and the <i>Birth in Brazil </i>study
				only considered those of normal obstetric risk; (2) PNDS asked about the occurrence
				of episiotomy in mothers of live births over the past 5 years, and important recall
				biases may occur. In the <i>Birth in Brazil</i> survey, the question was
				asked in the maternity, in the immediate post-partum; (3) the question PNDS asked
				was whether or not a cut was made in the vagina (episiotomy) <!--7--><span class="ref"><sup class="xref xrefblue">7</sup><span class="refCtt closed">7 <span> Ministério da Saúde. Pesquisa Nacional de Demografia e Saúde da
					Criança e da Mulher – PNDS 2006: dimensões do processo reprodutivo e da saúde da
					criança. Brasília: Ministério da Saúde; 2009. (Série G Estatística e Informação
					em Saúde).</span></span></span>, in the<i> Birth in Brazil</i> survey,
				the women were asked about how was their perineum after the birth, and the response
				alternatives were: It did not rupture, there was no cuts, and no stitches; There was
				a small rupture that did not need stitches; There were no stitches, but she does not
				know if there was rupture; There was rupture and she was stitched; They cut and
				stitched; Could not inform. It was considered that episiotomy was performed in those
				women who informed having been cut and stitched only, i.e., women who were sure the
				health practitioner had made an incision in the perineum. If we consider women who
				told they were sutured, the proportion would be 71% of those who had a vaginal
				delivery, which is very close to the proportion found by the PNDS. Thus, the
				question remains on whether we moved forward in this regard, or if the differences
				in the results of both investigations are due to the use of different
				methodologies.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Suzanne Serruya addresses the lack of autonomy by the woman to lead childbirth in
				Brazil, and mentions that the hospital routines establishing what can and what
				cannot be done are standardizing procedures that set aside “the unique and always
				particular experience of giving birth”. The hospital, as the traditional setting to
				treat sick people, imposes rules on fasting, being bedridden with an IV line,
				approaching birthcare to curative-therapeutic practices. The health practitioner is
				brought into the childbirth setting, and she highlights that the incorporation of
				scientific-based practices, which respect childbirth ownership by the woman can be
				very rewarding for them. That would contribute to decrease the asymmetry of power,
				and would open new possibilities, with a fresh role in labor and delivery, and the
				development of an environment of creativity and well-being. It must be said that
				similar to the asymmetry between health practitioners and users of the services,
				there is asymmetry also among health practitioners: doctors vs. nurses, nurses vs.
				nursing technicians, etc. Difficulties in working as a team generates an environment
				of isolation and of experiences not being shared, and, particularly in Brazil, the
				almost exclusion of the obstetric nurse/midwife in birthcare, just the opposite of
				what happens in developed countries. In this investigation, only 15% of the births
				were assisted by an obstetric nurse/midwife, and that was more often seen in areas
				with few doctors. Yet, it was seen that in vaginal deliveries assisted by obstetric
				nurses/midwives, the use of good practices were more frequent and obstetric
				interventions much less performed (data not shown), in accordance with what has been
				described in the international literature <!--8--><span class="ref"><sup class="xref xrefblue">8</sup><span class="refCtt closed">8 <span> Sandall J, Soltani H, Gates S, Shennan A, Devane D. Midwife-led
					continuity models versus other models of care for childbearing women. Cochrane
					Database Syst Rev 2013; 8:CD004667.</span></span></span>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Serruya also draws attention to the need of changes to occur in the professional
				training, something we fully agree with, given that the new cohorts of practitioners
				are being taught according to the same old practices. Thus, priority should be given
				to teaching hospitals in the development of the “Stork Network” an innovative
				strategy of the Ministry of Health intended to implement Normal Delivery Centers
				(NDCs) within hospitals or in their vicinities, while organizing a referral
				pre-natal care system for hospitals, transportation for the maternity,
				implementation of good practices for labor and birth, including the right of the
				woman to freely select a companion of her choice through the period of admission.
				Another feature of this program is to prioritize obstetric nurses/midwives in
				assisting habitual risk labor and delivery, in collaboration with the medical team,
				and also to promote setting adequacy and proper environment for physiological labor,
				delivery and birth <!--9--><span class="ref"><sup class="xref xrefblue">9</sup><span class="refCtt closed">9 <span> Ministério da Saúde. Portaria GM
						no 904, de 29 de maio de 2013. Diário
					Oficial da União 2013; 31 mai.</span></span></span>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Stork Network initiative is targeted to the public health system, which assists
				more than 75% of the childbirths among the Brazilian population; if it is duly
				implemented in the public health system, it can change the current birthcare
				scenario in Brazil, and impact obstetric and perinatal indicators of the
				country.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Soo Downe pinpoints the financial costs of unnecessary interventions that could be
				channeled to meet other health needs of the country, with which we agree in full.
				The 2010 WHO Global Health Report, in regards to the global costs of c-section
				procedures, noted that the excessive use of this technique was a barrier for the
				universal health coverage <!--10--><span class="ref"><sup class="xref xrefblue">10</sup><span class="refCtt closed">10 <span> Gibbons L, Belizan JM, Lauer JS, Betrán AP, Merialdi M, Althabe F.
					The Global Numbers and Costs of Additionally Needed and Unnecessary Caesarean
					Sections Performed per Year: Overuse as a Barrier to Universal Coverage. Geneva:
					World Health Organization; 2010. (World Health Report).</span></span></span>. This
				document indicates Brazil and China as being accountable for almost 50% of
				unnecessary c-section procedures in the world. In Brazil, if we add these costs to
				other costs for unnecessary interventions on vaginal delivery, we would have an
				astonishing amount of money wasted in the country.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Another important issue raised by Soo Downe were the ethical principles in the health
				practitioner/patient interaction, in which the first ethical commitment
					“<i>Primum non nocere: First, Do No Harm</i>” or the principle of
				non-maleficence, is one of the Hippocratic bioethical principles taught to
				health-related disciplines students worldwide. This principle is a reminder that
				health practitioners should always consider the possible harms an intervention may
				cause. The principle of beneficence, on the other hand, considers whether or not an
				action or intervention is beneficial enough, and how acceptable and appropriate it
				is. Despite differences of opinion, there are ideas broadly accepted, one of them
				being the ethical concept of respect to women in childbirth. In the lack of
				sufficiently established scientific evidences, for instance, in regards to good
				obstetric practices on walking <!--11--><span class="ref"><sup class="xref xrefblue">11</sup><span class="refCtt closed">11 <span> Lawrence A, Lewis L, Hofmeyr GJ, Styles C. Maternal positions and
					mobility during first stage labour. Cochrane Database Syst Rev 2013;
					8:CD003934.</span></span></span>,
				eating <!--12--><span class="ref"><sup class="xref xrefblue">12</sup><span class="refCtt closed">12 <span> Singata M, Tranmer J, Gyte GM. Restricting oral fluid and food
					intake during labour. Cochrane Database Syst Rev 2013;
					8:CD003930.</span></span></span>, freedom to select the
				position for delivery <!--13--><span class="ref"><sup class="xref xrefblue">13</sup><span class="refCtt closed">13 <span> Kemp E, Kingswood CJ, Kibuka M, Thornton JG. Position in the
					second stage of labour for women with epidural anaesthesia. Cochrane Database
					Syst Rev 2013; 1:CD008070.</span></span></span> etc., the
				recommendation is that the woman decides what is best for her.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The origins of the expression “humanization of childbirth” and the assessment of
				obstetric care as an event that ignores and emotional and social aspects of birth
				have guided different public policies in Brazil. Many researchers have investigated
				the understanding of the word “humanization”, describing its different (and many a
				time opposing) meanings, its possibilities of changing the medical culture, the
				understanding of the anatomy and physiology of women, and gender relations <!--14--><span class="ref"><sup class="xref xrefblue">14</sup><span class="refCtt closed">14 <span> Diniz CSG. Humanização da assistência ao parto no Brasil: os
					muitos sentidos de um movimento. Ciênc Saúde Coletiva 2005;
					10:627-37.</span></span></span>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In regards to the c-section procedure, it is argued that Brazilian women tend to
				perceive it as safer than vaginal birth, one that provides better quality of care,
				and, often, as an indicator of differences in social status <!--15--><span class="ref"><sup class="xref xrefblue">15</sup><span class="refCtt closed">15 <span> Behague DP, Victora CG, Barros FC. Consumer demand for caesarean
					sections in Brazil: informed decision making, patient choice, or social
					inequality? A population based birth cohort study linking ethnographic and
					epidemiological methods. BMJ 2002; 324:942-5.</span></span></span><sup>,</sup><!--16--><span class="ref"><sup class="xref xrefblue">16</sup><span class="refCtt closed">16 <span> Barros AJ, Santos IS, Matijasevich A, Domingues MR, Silveira M,
					Barros FC, et al. Patterns of deliveries in a Brazilian birth cohort: almost
					universal cesarean sections for the better-off. Rev Saúde Pública 2011;
					45:635-43.</span></span></span>. For some women, their attempt to medicalize the
				childbirth process is a practical solution to overcome the problems they face within
				the health system.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In terms of the socio-biological conditions that prompted the rapid increase in the
				use of technology to initiate, regulate and monitor the childbirth process, it is
				argued that vaginal delivery is perceived as being of high risk for the health of
				the woman and for her sexual life, which established the cut-above and cut-below
				paradigm of c-sections and episiotomies <!--17--><span class="ref"><sup class="xref xrefblue">17</sup><span class="refCtt closed">17 <span> Diniz SG, Chacham AS. “The cut above” and “the cut below”: the
					abuse of caesareans and episiotomy in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Reprod Health Matters
					2004; 12:100-10.</span></span></span>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The lack of consensus about non performing interventions in normal vaginal delivery
				is most certainly a crucial matter for discussion. To reduce unnecessary procedures,
				a ministerial ordinance for the Stork Network strategy defined normal vaginal
				delivery as a birth that started spontaneously, without being induced or expedited,
				without interventions such as the use of forceps or c-section performance, without
				the use of general, spinal-block or epidural anesthesia during childbirth <!--9--><span class="ref"><sup class="xref xrefblue">9</sup><span class="refCtt closed">9 <span> Ministério da Saúde. Portaria GM
						no 904, de 29 de maio de 2013. Diário

					de 24 de junho de 2011, que instituiu, no âmbito do SUS, a Rede Cegonha. Diário
					Oficial da União 2011; 27 jun.</span></span></span>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Soo Downe adds that recent publications have indicated long-term health hazards from
				the excessive use of obstetric technologies, such as oxytocin, antibiotics and other
				drugs, including the development of type 1 diabetes, asthma, multiple sclerosis,
				allergies, obesity, etc. Even though scientific evidences about these relations are
				weak, as they depend on a long period of accurate follow-up of birth cohorts, these
				hypotheses seem reasonable. The development of the epigenetic theory that reinforces
				the idea of multiple causes and reciprocal influences among the different levels of
				organization (molecular, cellular, organic, behavioral, and social) greatly enhanced
				the possibilities of understanding the development of illnesses in humans. <!--19--><span class="ref"><sup class="xref xrefblue">19</sup><span class="refCtt closed">19 <span> Dahlen HG, Kennedy HP, Anderson CM, Bell AF, Clark A, Foureur M,
					et al. The EPIIC hypothesis: intrapartum effects on the neonatal epigenome and
					consequent health outcomes. Med Hypotheses 2013; 80:656-62.</span></span></span>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Eugene Declercq is surprisd by Brazl’s insistence in systematically increase
				c-section rates, in opposition to some developed countries that have kept them on a
				stable, low-level rates, or to some other countries whose levels are not so low but
				that more recently started to work to lower them, and are being successful. He also
				questions if those women considered of normal obstetric risk attended by the private
				sector are different from those served by the public sector, to account for the
				higher rate of interventions in the former, and how the efforts of the Brazilian
				Ministry of Health may have influenced the higher frequency of good obstetric
				practices in the public sector.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We also share the wish of having, fairly soon, better days for childbirth care in
				Brazil, a country of continental size, with striking social and regional
				inequalities, which makes the analyses of health indicators and their determinants
				quite complex. The issues raised by Eugene Declercq are deep and impressive. It is
				certainly not possible to address them here in details, but we can provide an
				overview about what goes on in the country.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Childbirth-wise, the past 20 years were marked by intense discussions and conflicts.
				On one hand, the Brazilian Ministry of Health has been developing governmental
				initiatives to change the childbirth care model, such as regulating, with
				ordinances, the role of obstetric nursing/midwives, and the right of a companion
				during hospital-stay for childbirth, the implementation of normal delivery centers,
				the establishment of a maximum number of c-sections per facility, funding for
				adequacy of hospital settings, training of practitioners to comply with good
				obstetric practices, among others. The Brazilian Ministry of Health, aware that the
				development of protocols alone is not enough to change care-delivery practices, have
				adopted the strategy of having support people to work directly with the local teams
				to change the care-delivery routines and in the implementation of good practices.
				This was done, initially, in maternity clinics in the Northern and Northeastern
				areas of the country, and, more recently, in the whole country through the Stork
				Network.</p>
<p></p>
<p>However, there was no consensus in the adoption of these strategies. There has been
				some resistances to change voiced by some professional bodies, which often took some
				arbitrary measures that were beyond their mandate.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The governmental initiatives and the successful experiences of some clinics, the
				holding of scientific events where models from other countries were presented took
				place in tandem with a social movement of women requesting changes in the way
				birthcare is provided in the country. In consequence, there has been a growing
				number of discussion groups in social networks, street demonstrations and public
				rallies, articles about childbirth in the media, and an increase in the number of
				women who demand childbirth at home.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Over these 20 years, we have also seen an increase in the preference of women for
				c-section, from the beginning of the pregnancy. Such preference is according to
				having a c-section performed in a previous pregnancy, and private funding of
				childbirth. Women assisted by the private sector have higher socioeconomic status,
				more access to adequate prenatal care, and are seen by the same doctor throughout
				their pregnancy. It should be noted that, in the private sector, c-section is
				performed in almost 90% of deliveries, most of them with no medical indication <!--20--><span class="ref"><sup class="xref xrefblue">20</sup><span class="refCtt closed">20 <span> Leal MC, Pereira APE, Domingues RMSM, Theme Filha MM, Dias MAB,
					Nakamura-Pereira M, et al. Intervenções obstétricas durante o trabalho de parto
					e parto em mulheres brasileiras de risco habitual. Cad Saúde Pública 2014; 30
					Suppl: 17-47.</span></span></span><sup>,</sup><!--21--><span class="ref"><sup class="xref xrefblue">21</sup><span class="refCtt closed">21 <span> Domingues RMSM, Dias MAB, Nakamura-Pereira M, Torres JA, d’Orsi E,
					Pereira APE, et al. Processo de decisão pelo tipo de parto no Brasil: da
					preferência inicial das mulheres à via de parto final. Cad Saúde Pública 2014;
					30 Suppl:101-16.</span></span></span>. The option for a c-section is not influenced by
				the doctor only, but by a cultural scenario about the risks of vaginal birth which
				include a lack of assurance that the woman will have control of her childbirth
				process, will have a place at the maternity clinic, will have a doctor she knows at
				the time of delivery, and the fear of pain, among other reasons.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It should be noted that the higher use of obstetric interventions and c-sections in
				women served by the private sections has been observed in a number of countries
				around the world, not only in Brazil <!--22--><span class="ref"><sup class="xref xrefblue">22</sup><span class="refCtt closed">22 <span> Dahlen HG, Tracy S, Tracy M, Bisits A, Brown C, Thornton C. Rates

					health care coverage and increased risk of obstetric intervention. BMC Pregnancy
					Childbirth 2014; 14:13.</span></span></span> .</p>
<p></p>
<p>Finally, to conclude, we revisit the points mentioned by Maria A. Gomes, about the
				movements set in place in Brazil to change the obstetric care model. The good
				results found in the Southeastern area, particularly in the cities of Belo Horizonte
				and Rio de Janeiro, where an ongoing implementation of good perinatal care practices
				is developed. In Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo, more and more women with private
				health-care plans seek public maternity clinics to give birth, because of the option
				of having normal vaginal delivery, which is becoming rare in the private sector.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A relevant aspect we share is a national investment to qualify obstetric
				nurses/midwives, and the recent change in opinion of the Brazilian Federation of
				Gynecology and Obstetrics (FEBRASGO), which has passed to advocate practices known
				to increase the satisfaction of pregnant women with vaginal delivery, support of the
				Normal Delivery Centers, and the presence of obstetric nurses/midwives in birthcare,
				even in the private sector. This facts show an appreciation of scientific
				evidence-based obstetrics, fostering the hope that the model will effectively
				change.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The results shown in this study, of a smaller proportion of obstetric interventions
				in the Southeastern region may indicate a trend that will be consolidated with an
				increased role performed by the women in defining childbirth care policies, and
				improvement of the quality of such care in the Public Health System.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It was not by chance that the <i>Birth in Brazil</i> investigation took
				place at this point in time, with public funding, to unveil, for the first time on a
				national level, the scenario of delivery and childbirth care in Brazil. In order to
				change, all the players, institutions, non-governmental organizations, health
				practitioners, social movements, mothers, and families need, first of all, be aware,
				and bothered by this reality. We hope the <i>Birth in Brazil</i>
				investigation is of help in the completion of this step.</p>
