<p>The seminal role of human resources for health (HRH) in the attainment of health-related goals
has long been recognized and was recently reaffirmed by the United Nations General Assembly, which
identified the need for “an adequate, skilled, well-trained and motivated workforce”
to accelerate progress towards universal health coverage (UHC).<!--1--><span class="ref"><sup class="xref xrefblue">1</sup><span class="refCtt closed">1 <span>Resolution A/RES.63/33. Global health and foreign policy. In: United Nations

<p>Health workforce development is partly a technical process and, as such, it requires expertise in
human resource planning, education and management. It is also, however, a political process
requiring the will and the capacity to coordinate efforts on the part of different sectors and
constituencies in society and different levels of government. This theme issue on human resources
for UHC covers both of these aspects by providing examples of how countries have aligned political
will and sound technical strategies and by presenting new analytical tools and evidence surrounding
successful or promising innovative approaches.</p>

<p>Only systemic action can address deep-seated challenges in the area of HRH; only sustained
political commitment can, in turn, provide a basis for such action. By linking the evidence to the
policies and politics surrounding health workforce development, this theme issue provides a
foundation for the Third Global Forum on Human Resources for Health and, more generally, for a
health workforce discourse instrumental in the pursuit of UHC.<!--19--><span class="ref"><sup class="xref xrefblue">19</sup><span class="refCtt closed">19 <span>Cometto G, Witter S. Tackling health workforce challenges to universal health

<p></p>
<p>We, the national and international partners convening the Third Global Forum on Human Resources
for Health, encourage everyone to support an ambitious and transformative agenda that places
citizens' right to health at the heart of development policies and that treats progress in
the area of HRH as a key driver of broader health system development. We call upon national leaders
to confirm their commitment to this agenda by creating a governance and policy environment that is
conducive to the transformative development of HRH and by investing the necessary resources in
health workforce development, deployment and management. We also call upon health workforce planners
and managers to adopt and put in place effective, evidence-based policies. Finally, we call upon the
international community to work together on the development of HRH as a shared global priority and
to let all its actions be inspired by the principles of international solidarity, multilateral
collaboration and mutual accountability.</p>
